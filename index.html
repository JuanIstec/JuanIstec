    <h2>What Are Computers?</h2>
    <p>
      A <strong>computer</strong> is an electronic device that processes data and performs tasks according to instructions called programs. Computers can store, retrieve, and process information, making them essential tools in our daily lives, from work to entertainment.
    </p>
    <h2>How Do Computers Work?</h2>
    <p>
      Computers operate by receiving input (data or commands), processing that data using their internal components, and producing output (results or actions). The process typically involves four steps: input, processing, output, and storage. Software (programs) tells the computer how to perform specific tasks.
    </p>
    <h2>The Most Important Part of a Computer</h2>
    <p>
      The most important part of a computer is the <strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</strong>. The CPU, also known as the "brain" of the computer, carries out instructions and processes data. It controls all the operations within the computer.
    </p>
    <h2>Main Components of a Computer</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>CPU (Central Processing Unit):</b> Executes instructions and processes data.</li>
      <li><b>RAM (Random Access Memory):</b> Temporary memory that stores data and instructions while the computer is running.</li>
      <li><b>Motherboard:</b> The main circuit board that connects all components.</li>
      <li><b>Storage (Hard Drive or SSD):</b> Stores all data, software, and files.</li>
      <li><b>Power Supply:</b> Provides electrical power to the computer.</li>
      <li><b>Input Devices:</b> Such as keyboard and mouse, allow users to enter data.</li>
      <li><b>Output Devices:</b> Such as monitor and printer, display or produce results.</li>
      <li><b>Graphics Card (GPU):</b> Handles graphics and images, especially important for gaming and design.</li>
    </ul>
